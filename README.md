# Ultralogger

## Overview

The Ultralogger is a compact and lightweight data logger intended for use on both low and high power rockets. The Ultralogger is capable of measuring altitudes through 100,000 feet (30,500 meters), acceleration up to 200g, and temperature between -40 and 185 Farenheit (-40 to 85 Celsius). 

Using the Micro USB port, the integrated battery can be charged, settings can be configured, and data can be downloaded. 

USB-Configurable Settings Include:
* Select between metric and Imperail units
* Adjustable logging rate, up to 20Hz
* Set altitude mode to absolute (ASL) or relative (AGL of launch pad, automatically acquired)
* Variable liftoff detection, using customizable acceleration and/or altitude thresholds. Both can also be disabled to auto-start recording on powerup.

Settings can also be changed after flight but before downloading the data if you forgot to configure something before launch, such as swapping the units. 

At the maximum recording speed of 20Hz, the Ultralogger can record for up to 13 minutes. Automatic liftoff and landing detection maximize recording time and help preserve battery life.

Data is recorded in solid-state memory that will last more than 40 years without power. Data can be downloaded using any serial terminal software, allowing compatability with all major computer operating systems and many phones.
